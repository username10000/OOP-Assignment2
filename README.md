## Polygon Wars
Polygon Wars is a procedurally generated Tower Defence game. In this type of game the user must prevent the enemies from reaching the bottom of the map. This is done by using Towers to destroy the enemies. There are three types of towers: one that shoots bullets, one that fires a laser and one that has a field that damages all the enemies in it. Each Tower can also have its damage, speed and range upgraded.

### Main Menu

In the Main Menu the user can either start a New Game, Load a Game, Import a Map or Exit. The first choice lets the user only access the first of the nine levels. To progress further the user must finish the previous levels. A game can also be loaded from file where the levels unlocked and the score for each level is stored. The user can also load a map from file using the Import Map option from the menu.

### Level Select

From the Level Select screen the user can select a level to play. The player cannot access locked levels which are shown as having a grey colour. Also when a level is hovered over the maximum score achieved for that level is shown. The total score is also shown at the top of the screen.

### Levels

This is an example of a level. In the top left of the screen the remaining points are shown. In the top right corner there are a number of squares which represent the number of "hearts" (lives) the player has left. In the bottom left corner there is a box that shows the number of enemies left to finish the level. To place a Tower the player must click the mouse on a available cell (shown as having a green colour when hovered over) and select one of the Towers from the menu. To upgrade a Tower the player must click on a Tower and select the desired upgrade from the menu.
